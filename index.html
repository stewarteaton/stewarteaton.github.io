            <h5><u>Overview:</u></h5>
            <p>Developed a full stack Node.js demo website that allows users to create an account, query a database, and book hotels. Admins are able to add, remove, or edit existing hotels in a real time cloud database.
            </br>User input is validated and sanitized for protection, user login uses middleware for authentication, and user sessions are implemented using server side storage and cookies to pass identification.
            </br>A seperate cloud storage is configured to hold images/videos and add security to files. Various middlewares are used to handle errors and validate/encrypt user data when communicating with the MongoDB database.</br>Environment variables are created to protect all sensitive information.</br>PUG templating language was used to build organized, reusable html.</p>

                <h5><u>The Motive:</u></h5>
                    <p>Having spent lots of time backpacking internationally (Europe, Asia, and counting...), I constantly rely on travel booking websites like hostelworld.com. So I wanted to create my own travel booking application
                        with similar functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the same time, I wanted to further my knowledge of web development and learn how to make a Node.js fullstack application along with a RESTful API backend.</p>
                <h5><u>The Execution:</u></h5>
                    <p>This project began from taking an online full stack web development course from skillshare.com. Through this course I was able to learn the process of creating a production build application from scratch while being able to customize any component. </p>
                    <p>The first step was using the integrated terminal in Visual Studio to install and set up the JavaScript Express framework which uses the Node.js server-side platform. </p>
                    <p>I decided to install and use PUG in order to structure and organize my HTML. PUG, formerly known as 'Jade', is an open source HTML templating language that provides the ability to write dynamic and reusable HTML documents.</p>
                    <p>MongoDB was used as the database to store JSON data because of its flexible model and scalability. I implemented MongoDB using mLab's free hosting cloud service offered by Amazon web services.</p>
                    <p>The Model View Controller (MVC) architecture is used in order to separate the logic into three distinct components</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Model: For the model section I installed and used Mongoose library to provide object data modeling. With mongoose, I created schemas to map and structure the database by setting parameters required by all forms and information passed back and forth from the database. </li>
                        <li>View: The user interface was created using PUG, which allowed me to render dynamic data from the database to the interface. I made reusable templates, known as mixins, to display frequently accessed interfaces such as hotel listings, search forms, and database forms. When calling these mixins I took advantage of conditional rendering to achieve the desired functionality depending on the user request.</li>
                        <li>Controller: The controllers are JavaScript files that provide the functionality of sending and recieving data from the database and connecting the models and interface. Asnychronous database requests were utilized to allow the browser to remain responsive while making sure the requests were fully processed before the results were rendered.
                            <ul>
                                <li>User: I created a controller to handle all user login, validation, and session information. When signing up, the express validation and sanitization node modules were configured to check all user input to prevent any malicious data being passed to the database. Passport middleware was installed and used to authenticate users when logging in, and bcyrpt.js middleware was installed to encrypt(salt) passwords in the database for added security. This controller also provides the logic for sending booking information to database and creating orders in database within individual user accounts.</li>
                                <li>Hotel: This controller handles posting, editing, and removing hotels from the database. Cloudinary and Multer middleware are installed and used to post images directly to cloud storage, where they are later requested when rendered. This controller parses the user search queries and sends that information to the database using the aggregation pipeline to match data from mutlipile documents and return the desired results to the interface.
                            </ul>
                        </li> 
                    </ul>
                    <p>Express router perfomed get and post requests for specified HTTP addresses between client and server by linking the url with javascript controllers. Passed middleware through router with callback functions.</p>
                    <p>Configuring user sessions was achieved by installing express-session and connect-mongo, and then setting up the session as middleware and passing a secret key to sign cookies. Every time a user successfully signs in a session is created by passing user id stored in cookie to server and in turn recieves user information.
                    </br>With sessions properly working, I then installed connect-flash and configured it as middleware in order to present flash messages which notify users when actions were successfully executed or not.
                     </p>
                    
                    <p>Environment variables created by collecting all sensitive infomration in a .env file. This includes the MongoDB connection link, Cloudinary api secret and key, and the secret used for signing cookies in user sessions. Dotenv package was installed and configured allowing environment varialbes values to be used while keeping them protected.</p>
                    <p>Compression was intalled and used to prepare app for production along with the helmet package for added security before deployment to Heroku.</p>

            <h3>Algae Photo-Bioreactor</h3>
            <h5><u>Overview:</u></h5>
            <p>Created a bioreactor designed to grow a specialized algae, or cyanobacteria, known as spirulina. Spirulina is an edible algae that boasts a remarkable nutrition profile. Studied the effects of pH, salinity, light energy, and chemical nutrients with respect to the algae's growth productivity and quality</p>

            <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="moreAlgaeBtn" id="moreAlgaeBtn" onclick="expandAlgae()">More Details...</a>
            <div id="algaeDetails" class="algaeDetails">
                    <h5><u>The Motive:</u></h5>
                    <p>Algae has many special and unique characteristics which enable future opportunities to reshape several industries including pollution control, commercial food, pharmaceutical, wastewater treatment, and biofuels to name a few.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to cultivate my own spirulina in order further my understanding of the biochemical process of successfully producing algae along with the desire to process and consume my spirulina as a nutritional supplement.</p>
                    <h5><u>The Execution:</u></h5>
                    <p>Spirulina grows optimally in strong sun light, high temperatures, and strong alkaline environments.<br>There are 4 main parameters to consider when attempting to grow spriluna: 
                        <ul>
                            <li><u>1. Culture Medium:</u> it's mandatory to supply the spirulina with the right nutrients and water conditions to grow. First I filled my reactor with distilled water to prevent the chance of other mircoorganisms contaminating the media. Spirulina needs the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Highly alkaline water: approximate pH of 10</li>
                                <li>Source of nitrogen, iron, phosphorous, potassium, and sulfur</li>
                                <li>Source of carbon</li>
                                <li>Trace amounts of chlorine, calcium, and magnesium</li>
                            </ul>
                            <img src="project pics/spirulinaNutrients.JPG"></br>
                            I used food grade NaHCO3(sodium bicarbonate) to achieve elevated alkalinity and NaNO3(sodium nitrate) as a source of fixed nitrogen. KCl(potassium chloride), Na2SO4(sodium sulfate), and NaH2PO4(sodium phosphate) is dissolved together to provide potassium, chlorine, sulfur, and phosphorous.</br>
                            Lastly, I added small percentages FeSO4*7H2O(iron sulfate), MgSO4*7H2O(magnesium sulfate), and CaCl2*2H20(calcium chloride) to supplement iron, magnesium and calcium.

                            <li><u>2. Light:</u> For optimal growth its recommended to expose spirulina to 16 hours of light per day with an intensity up to 120,000 lux. Spirulina contains a variety of pigments in addition to chlorophyll that are activated at different wavelengths including phycocyanins and allophycocyanins, which allow absorption of a more broad spection of light frequency focusing on red, orange, and blue. Due to my limitations of using an indoor reactor, I decided to place my tank next to a window recieving lots of sunlight. I supplemented the natural ambient light with an artificial grow light. </li>
                            <li><u>3. Temperature:</u>Reserach shows that spirulina will survive bewteen 32 and 110 degrees fahrenheit, but growth will be exponentially more effective between 87 t0 97 degrees Fahrenheit. Electric heaters can be used to keep indoor reactors warm, and shading/misting outdoor reactors can be used to keep more cool. </li>
                            <li><u>4. Mixing:</u>If you're relying on ambient CO2 as a carbon source, its imperative to have good tank agitation to ensure adequate mass transfer. Mixing helps keep the spirulina suspended in ciruculaiton allowing all cells to get equal amounts of light and keep nutruents thoroughly dissolved preventing dead zones in the tank. For my reactor I have two pumps. One power head thats connected to a tube which sucks up liquid from the bottom and redirects it at the top to create a cyclic cirulation, and I have a rotaing paddle wheel at the top of the tank which helps keeping the culture fully mixed and dissolved.</li>
                            <li><u>5. Reactor:</u>An ideal reactor is one that has a high transparency, yet is stable and affordable. A high surface area to volume ratio is desirable to because light penetration become very hindered once algae nears harvest.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>By using a microscope, I can take samples of the algae to monitor and record the health of the cells, levels of contamination, and nutrient defeciencies in correlation with the current tank conditions. I'm able to measure the pH, salinity, and temperature with handheld digital readers. Optical density is recorded using a spectromoter which essentially displays the density of the culture with respect to light penetration, and this value can be used to share growth productivity and time ready to harvest. By understanding these basic concepts, I'm able to manipulate some of the variables and test which scenarious are favorable for the spirulina.</p>
                    <h5><u>Future Considerations:</u></h5>
                        <p>I would like to one day set up a field of outdoor bioreactors which are all connecting to a network, allowing instant real time recording of tank parameters. With an automated system, I could write scripts that constantly scanned the database and notified growers when certain nutrients, temperatures, or harvesting needed to occur. There are lots of opportunities in setting up spirulina grow ops that leverage its insanely fast grow rate with its low water/space requirements, making it ideal for areas around the world with food shortages.</p>
